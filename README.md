## Advanced features

### Collision detection
Detect the contact between ball and floor, a function will detect if the ball is on the floor. The force on the ball is different when it has contact with the surface or not.
<br/>

### Physics-based simulation

**Gravitational acceleration**<br/>
Simulate gravity so the ball can free fall, roll, slide and rebound.<br/>

**Rolling**<br/>
Simulate a ball's motion on a surface with minimum friction.<br/>

**Elastic collision**<br/>
Simulate elastic collision so the ball will bounce on the ice surface. <br/>
<br/>

## How to run

## How to play
Keep the ball balced on the floor. **Harder than it looks!**<br> 
The game will initialize with a slight random angle, try your best use `W A S D` to tilt the angle of the floor. 
Press `X` to restart. Your score will increment by 10 every second your ball survives. 
Keep it rolling as long as possible Good luck. <br>
Oh by the way, it bounces!
